### Defender for Cloud `Development security operations (DevSecOps), cloud security posture management (CSPM), cloud workload protection platform (CWPP) solution`


## 1. Configure Microsoft Defender for Servers:
- A Cloud-Native Extended Detection and Response (XDR) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) tool.
- Brings threat detection and advanced defenses to your `Windows and Linux machines that run in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and on-premises environments.`
- plan includes the integrated license for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, security baselines and OS level assessments, vulnerability assessment scanning, adaptive application controls (AAC), file integrity monitoring (FIM), and more.

## 2. Microsoft Defender for Azure SQL Database:
- `Microsoft Defender for Azure SQL databases, SQL servers on machines, open-source relational databases, Azure Cosmos DB.`
- This service enhances database security by monitoring suspicious activities and providing actionable security alerts, thereby improving the overall security posture of Azure SQL Databases.

## 3. Microsoft Defender for Containers:
- CNAP solution `to improve, monitor, and maintain the security of` your containerized assets (`Kubernetes clusters, Kubernetes nodes, Kubernetes workloads, container registries, container images` and more), and their applications, across multicloud and on-premises environments.
- 4 main Domains: Security posture management, Vulnerability assessment (Agentless), Run-time threat protection, Deployment & monitoring.

## 4. Defender for Container architecture:
- `Defender for Containers architecture`
-  Defender for Containers receives and analyzes:
```
Audit logs and security events from the API server
Cluster configuration information from the control plane
Workload configuration from Azure Policy
Security signals and events from the node level
```

## 5. Microsoft Defender for Containers components:
- 
```
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - Microsoft's managed service for developing, deploying, and managing containerized applications.
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) in a connected Amazon Web Services (AWS) account - Amazon's managed service for running Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in a connected Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project - Googleâ€™s managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling applications using GCP infrastructure.
Other Kubernetes distributions (using Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes) - Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters hosted on-premises or on IaaS.

## 6. Microsoft Defender for Cloud DevOps Security:
- DevOps security within Defender for Cloud uses a central console to empower security teams with the ability to protect applications and resources from code to cloud across multi-pipeline environments, including Azure DevOps, GitHub, and GitLab. DevOps security recommendations can then be correlated with other contextual cloud security insights to prioritize remediation in code.




## Note:
1. Configure workflow automation:
- `To deploy your automation configurations across your organization, use the supplied Azure Policy 'DeployIfNotExist'` policies described below to create and configure workflow automation procedures.
- To create a rule, you need permissions to edit a policy in Azure Policy, Changes might take up to 24 hours to take effect.

2. Workflow automation enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of responding to security alerts, allowing for quicker remediation of identified threats.

3. Microsoft Defender for Servers configured to protect cloud environments ensures that servers are protected using the latest security intelligence and automation, enhancing the cloud environment's security.

4. Enabling workload protection services provides advanced threat protection for a wide range of Azure resources, thereby enhancing the overall security posture.

5. `Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters extend Azure management capabilities to Kubernetes clusters running outside of Azure`, enabling unified management, governance, and monitoring across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
