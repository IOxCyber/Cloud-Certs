# Microsoft Purview's governance solutions:
- To manage your on-premises, multicloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data.
- Using the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog, Data Map, Data Sharing, Data Estate Insights, and Policies

## Data classification in the Microsoft Purview governance portal:
- a `way of categorizing data assets by assigning unique logical tags or classes to the data assets.`
- Classification is based on the business context of the data.
- For example, you might classify assets by Passport Number, Driver's License Number, Credit Card Number, SWIFT Code, Personâ€™s Name, and so on.
- `Classification is the process of organizing data into logical categories that make the data easy to retrieve, sort, and identify for future use.`
- Types of classification:  System (200+) & Custom Type

## Auditing for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics: 
- Auditing for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics tracks database events and writes them to an audit log in your Azure storage account, Log Analytics workspace, or Event Hubs.

```
Limitations:

Enabling auditing on a paused Azure Synapse SQL pool isn't supported. To enable auditing, resume the Synapse SQL pool.
Enabling auditing by using User Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) isn't supported on Azure Synapse.
Currently, managed identities are not supported for Azure Synapse, unless the storage account is behind a virtual network or firewall.
```

1. Data Map:
-  A `cloud native PaaS service that captures metadata about enterprise data present in analytics and operation systems on-premises and cloud.`
-  Automatically kept up to date with built-in automated scanning and classification system.
2. `Data Catalog`	`Finds trusted data sources` by browsing and searching your data assets. The data catalog aligns your assets with friendly business terms and data classification to identify data sources.
3. `Data Estate Insights`	Gives you an overview of your data estate to help you discover `what kinds of data you have and where it is.`
4. `Data Sharing`	Allows you to `securely share data internally or cross organizations` with business partners and customers.
5. `Data Policy`	A `set of central, cloud-based experiences` that help you provision access to data securely and at scale.

## Transparent data encryption (TDE):
- `encrypts SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Synapse Analytics data files.`
- This encryption is known as encrypting data at rest.

## Notes:
- `Applies to:  SQL Server  Azure SQL Database  Azure SQL Managed Instance  Azure Synapse Analytics  Analytics Platform System (PDW)`
- TDE isn't available for system databases. It can't be used to encrypt master, model, or msdb.
- If you make the certificates password protected after TDE uses them, the database becomes inaccessible after a restart.

## Dynamic data masking:
- `Applies to:  SQL Server 2016 (13.x) and later  Azure SQL Database  Azure SQL Managed Instance  Azure Synapse Analytics`
- Dynamic data masking (DDM) limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to nonprivileged users.
- The purpose of dynamic data masking is to limit exposure of sensitive data, preventing users who shouldn't have access to the data from viewing it.
- Users with CONTROL SERVER or CONTROL at the database level could view masked data in its original form.
- This includes admin users or roles such as sysadmin, serveradmin, db_owner etc.****


## Always Encrypted:
- `Applies to:  SQL Server  Azure SQL Database  Azure SQL Managed Instance`
- ### `Always Encrypted is a feature designed to protect sensitive data` stored in Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and SQL Server databases.
- Such as credit card numbers or national/regional identification numbers (for example, U.S. social security numbers).

## Database permissions:
```
There are four database permissions for Always Encrypted:

ALTER ANY COLUMN MASTER KEY - required to create and delete column master key metadata.

ALTER ANY COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY - required to create and delete column encryption key metadata.

VIEW ANY COLUMN MASTER KEY DEFINITION - required to access and read the column master key metadata, which is needed to query encrypted columns.

VIEW ANY COLUMN ENCRYPTION KEY DEFINITION - required to access and read the column master key metadata, which is needed to query encrypted columns.
