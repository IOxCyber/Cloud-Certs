## Plan and implement advanced security for compute:

- Azure Bastion: Managed PaaS enabling secure RDP/SSH to Azure VMs, accessed directly via Azure portal or native clients, without requiring public IPs or VPNs.
- Hardening: Process of securing a system by reducing its attack surface and minimizing vulnerabilities.
- Auditing enables tracking of database access and activities, helping to identify unauthorized actions and ensure compliance with security policies.
- Always Encrypted provides a comprehensive encryption solution, protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle.
- TDE encrypts stored data, ensuring it remains inaccessible to unauthorized users without the appropriate encryption keys.
- The Microsoft Purview governance portal provides tools for discovering, classifying, and managing sensitive data across an organization's data estate.
- Microsoft Entra database authentication enhances security by allowing for Microsoft Entra ID-based authentication, providing a more secure and manageable access control mechanism.
